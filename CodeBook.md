## Viewing the data

You can view the tidy data set by saving it and reading it into R with:

tidy <- read.table("tidy.txt", header=TRUE)
View(tidy)

## Source of data

The source of the underlying data was from 

"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0 by
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

Their README.txt is located in the "UCI HAR Dataset" zip file.

The tidy data set presents the mean of specific variables of the original experiment which were themselves means or standard deviations of collections of accelerometer data from smart phones worn by volunteers while doing specific activities.  I encourage you to read their README.txt for full details of the data collection and processing.

## Variables

### subject_id

Identifies which volunteer the data comes from.

### activity

Identifies what physical activity the volunteer was performing at the time of these measurements.

### variable

Variable is the name of one of the original measurement types which was already a mean or standard deviation.  (I interpreted meanFreq to not be a mean of a measurement and did not include those.) More discussion of these further down. 

### mean(value)

The fourth column in the data set is the mean value for the set of observations of variable for the given subject_id and activity. (Even if that's the mean of a set of observed  standard deviations, for variables named with "std", such as for tBodyGyro.std.X.)

## Activities

There are 6 possibilities for what the volunteers were doing during a measurement:

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The column numericActivity lists the number; the column Activity has the name.
